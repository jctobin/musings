the exhaustion of learning
the value of a conference
conference publishes everything online, so the 'benefit' of the conference is inherently purely from the social interactions
within the context of an analytics community many->most of the individuals are introverts
i dont mean the way some understand things as introverts, as in, someone who doesn't want to interact with people, but rather the flow of energy
folks who are extroverts receive energy from social interactions, introverts lose energy from those same interactions
sarah noticed that until the ice was broken at the lunch tables, no one would talk
just silenced eating
then someone would ask a question and the table would erupt into conversation, laughter, and seeming fun
would the people at the table have enjoyed their time better if it was silent?
were many people just faking enjoyment in the conversation?
was it a case of 'glad it is happening, but im gonna need a break from this in the VERY near future'
then you sit silently, absorbing as much content as you can for a couple hours, rinse and repeat
is there a correlation between engagement and enjoyment?
at what point has it been 'too much' ?
obviously different for different people, but is there a general sense of 'after X hours allow Y time of purely optional socialling?'
do you not 'allow' or encourage the isolation? research suggests human interaction is a good thing
how much of the time spent at a conference is groups of people pretending theyre social people
more fundamentally, is social interaction the optimal avenue within a conference?
can we not know bc people who don't want to be with groups of people at all wont go to conferences?
so, if we premise that people that will never want to interact with a large group wont pay for a conference 
now we can start to say that there might be optimal patterns for dealing with this new subset of a population
are you supposed to leave a conference feeling exhausted? like you might a sporting event?
happy you did it, but it was a lot, learned a lot, but tired
is there an avenue for feeling energized after a conference?
i have not talked with, nor heard anyone who is feeling energized, many are just 'trying to make it through before heading out
should that be the goal of a conference? to have people feeling energized to take on the world?
if you leave feeling good, does that mean you didnt 'work' hard enough during the conference?
how could a conference go that was long enough to build relationships/do cool things, but when people leave, they leave hungry, excited, and ready to do things
would that be more of a hackathon, instead of a conference?
is that because a hackaton has a definitive artifact?
a conference only has 'knowledge' and 'conversation'
what if a conference was treated like active learning? yes, show off cool things, but have interactions within 
how hard would that be
