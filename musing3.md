I listened to Malcolm Gladwell talk about the difference between a Picasso and a Cézanne. The instant genius vs the genius that only reveals itself over time (Revisionist History - Hallelujah). Then I found myself listening to Ludovico Einaudi's 7-Days-Walking set of episodes/albums and I read the quote:
 > The recording process has always exhausted me. Since the first times, it turned into a challenge with yourself. You want to reach a certain perfection, but perfection does not exist…
and am immediately brought back to Gladwell's notion of Cézanne. Comparing Einaudi to Kanye sounds absurd, yet those two are probably my most played artists on spotify. And I think I finally understand why. Kanye brings to the table that seemingly effortless production of music that sticks with you. His flamboyance, the absosolutely wild things he says and does. Anti-Einaudi, Anti-Cézanne. Perfectly Picasso. Regarding one of his most famous song's "Runaway" this quote is from Emile Haynie 
 > He probably had listened to the beat for four minutes, and got in the booth, and almost verbatim to what’s on the song today, just did it. 
Four minutes was all it took. Sure, it got edited a few more times after that, but there wasn't some grandiose exploration into that space. There was not a Einaudi-style "I walked the same path in the Alps every day for months and from that found my music. But I couldnt master it, so I present you with 7 days worth of variations." I often wonder if I am the sort that is spending days on end conjuring solutions to a problem. Do I have some more grand plan that I am or should be working on?
In one of our small group meetings, one of my friends revealed that "I look for the long term solutions to problems. I work through the rough details. Assess its plausability; and if its possible, and only then, will I tackle it." He's planning days, weeks, maybe even years worth of activities potential steps. He's in a great spot in his life probably at least partially because of those traits. On the other end of the spectrum, if I can't envision a solution that I can craft and execute before I'm bored of the topic, I'm likely not gonna even start on it. For example, I was asked multiple times last year "do you want to do a half-marathon with me? what about a triathalon? you *should* do this with me." etc. For which I declined all the offers partly because I wanted to be lazy. Partly because I knew that in order to acomplish those goals would require an actual life change. I wouldn't be able to just wing it. Running 13.1 miles in one go with no training (or minimal training) without potentially injuring myself or just passing out sounded unattainable. I felt challenged though with the last time I was asked. It came right on the heels of a conversation in which I stated "I dont know what I can or should do with my life. I'm not passionate about anything, but God's granted me the gifts to do pretty much anything." Another member of my small group then asked "Then why not say yes to people. why not do more things and see what, if anything sticks." as a 'no-sayer' and a proud no-sayer at that, I didn't *want* to do that. Almost on queue, the next day he sent me an email asking "will you do this ironman with me?". All I could hear in the back of my mind was "you should say yes more". So, to his surprise, I said "yup, im in. lets do this.". I am a Picasso. Things come easy. I do them, I move on, rinse-and-repeat. But to do an Iron Man is not a Picasso task. It is not something I can relatively master in minutes, or even weeks. I'm going to have to work on it pretty much every day for the next year. There's an added benefit that I get to raise money for WorldVision, a charity devoted to providing water to those without. It's a great charity, bringing water to 4 million people among other things (check out https://www.worldvision.org/our-work for more stats and consider donating to []). 
At this point I've probably devolved from the idea of Genius that Gladwell was trying to get at. An iron-man probably isn't "genius", most people with adequate resources could probably do it. I happen to be fortunate enough to have the time, the money for a gym membership (i aint running in the snow), and a body that has the potential to complete it. There are billions of people in the world who do not have at Least one of those 3 things. Maybe I'm getting to the root of my argument. Planning, adjusting, and executing a plan is a form of genius all on its own. This might be going completely in a different direction, but I think tying all these thoughts together at any point will be a good start to trying to flush out everything.
Bad things happen. They do. You can plan all you want, but sometimes it just doesn't go your way. On the other hand, you can dramatically reduce the number of bad things that happen, or at least their potential. I remember my basketball coach in high-school reading from the newspaper about the game we had the previous night "They just got all the bounces" the article said. To which my coach guffawed. "We put ourselves in positions for the bounces. Remember when we drew that play they ran up and said 'if they pass here, jump the next passing lane? and then we got 'a lucky bounce'? Remember when on this play every player boxed out their man and the ball again 'just bounced our way'? these weren't luck. these were planned and executed to perfection.. I remember watching the documentary "Do Your Job" on the Super Bowl XLIX where Butler intercepts Wilson to seal the game for the Patriots. In their they show that they knew that play *could* happen. they practiced it. literally the same exact play. In practice Butler doesn't "do his job". he looks elsewhere and misses the play. It happens So fast, less than a second of taking your eyes off your assignement lead to a failure in practice. Then it got corrected. In the game he sees the same thing he saw in practice and responds appropriately. I would argue that that is genius on the part of the Patriots. Long term, molded, melded, iterated upon genius. 
Is being in shape genius? Is sleeping more genius? Is eating right genius? Most would argue no. At least I think most would say that. But when we look at the current death trends in the world, specifically the avoidable deaths. ALL of them, and I mean all, can be at least minimally mitigated by exercise, diet, and sleep. The evidence for this is overwhelming. And I'm not talking like the evidence for climate change overwhelming (which should be. dont get me started.) This evidence is all of the sort that the every day person can understand. "If you exercise regularly, you will have a 5-10% decrease in blood pressure." Most of us go to the doctor and have some idea of what that means. From a talk by Matthew Walker (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEbtf7uS6P8) he talks about all the positive effects of sleep. he, of course, is severely biased towards people sleeping more, but with the evidence he has backing him, I can't fight facts. Its a pretty long talk, but one of the things I remember most about it was the "what if people get 1 more hour of sleep, or 1 less hour. y'know, like daylight savings time. this leads to a 20% increase in heart attacks when we lose an hour and a 20% swing the other way when we gain an hour. That's a 40% swing because of 1 hour of sleep difference. THAT'S CRAZY!! There were a lot of cool studies and stats in their talk, but that stark contrast blew my mind. Similarly and more to the point, there is a segment where he talking about how pulling an all-nighter decreases learning capacity by 40 percent. Having gone to college and seeing the activities of myself and MANY of my classmates, what I'm hearing, i think, is that with a little more fore-thought we could have all been smarter. i dont think there was ever a case where an all-nighter was Necessary. I did them, sure, but that was mostly because I didn't have any sort of a plan, at least not one that I stuck to. That's the case for almost every student. All-nighters are not necessary, but we see a deadline 4 days out and think 'i can go hang out with my friends, have a real life, its 4 days away'. then it becomes the night before its due and we rush to make something happen, because now the time it would have taken and the time that is remaining before its due are almost equal. I remember trying something different with my educational psychology class my senior year. I reviewed the new material every day, and would look back at related materials for some of the previous lessons almost every day as well. I didn't spend more than 30 minutes on it, but I did it each day. When it came time for the exams I didn't even consider an all-nighter, I went back through my notes and what-not once or twice, but felt very comfortable in my knowledge of the course material. Needless to say, I got one of my best grades in that class. Plan. Adjust. Execute. Genius. 
This new notion of genius feels akin to the premise of "judge an elephant by how high it can climb a tree and you'll be disappointed". And now harkens me back to the talk Malcolm Gladweel gave at the Alteryx Inspire conference. In it he was talking about the LSAT and how we require lawyers to regurgitate information in a short timeline. However, in most cases of real life, the lawyer will work a case for EASILY more than 2.5 hours. They don't need to often make snap judgements or decisions, but can study, plan, and research to an astounding degree. So we're now measuring law-genius on a Picasso-scale. know it now, or else. But most of law is more on the Cézanne-scale. I remember learning about gradients in calc3 and at that time I just didnt' get it. Then while reading about different optimizers 5 years after that, I *suddenly* understood. I did not have the instant-genius, for understanding those concepts during my days of not sleeping. But after researching related topics for hours on end, I got it. Sometimes I wish I could go back to college and see what grades I would get in the same courses that at the time felt so hard.

I've now typed 1800 words on bout 5 different semi-related topics. So I'm up to about 3 pages of 'material'. with a likely 3 more pages of things if I flesh out some of these thoughts. 6 pages is not a book. 6 pages is not a short enough thing for anyone to browse through, I cant even get coworkers to read through 30 bullet points let alone 3 paragraphs or now multiple pages of thoughts/ideas. Perhaps Twitter/Reddit has us too accustomed to receiving all the information we want/need in short spurts. Our attention span as a society is reduced (hello symptom of sleep loss). Yet we teach college kids to write theses. we teach to write a 20-page paper. no one cares that much about 20 pages. although now the average recipe page for food seems to be 20 pages. Ooo cool Sharon, I'm glad you went on a vacation with your family, I don't really care about that, just please let me read about your grilled chicken penne alfredo recipe. and thanks for the popup asking me if i want to join your newsletter. again, no sharon. i just want to know if i should when i should the milk and how much milk i should add. but this is a now a very different topic and doesnt belong here at all. but again, here i type. spewing forth ideas as i think about them. procrastinating making a vareity of sample models. even though that legitamely sounds fun. Is putting forth a ton of thoughts on to paper really the best use of my time? reminds me of a statement I made in my small group text chat. we (or rather, the rest of the group, i opted out) is going through Proverbs commenting on 'what', 'so what', and 'now what' for specific verses within a chapter. I looked at that and thought , this will lead me to rabbit holes, sort of like the one im on now. its probably a good thing, to dig deeper into a mentality, and/or to document one's thoughts/feelings/etc, but what if you're doing it to avoid something else. what if your 'good' is not the 'right good'. what if saying 'yes' to this idea, beacuse it should be quick and easy is the wrong good. With today's society of having nearly unlimited options of things to do at a given time perhaps there is too much choice. there is too much opportunity to do things that literally dont matter. or matter but not as much. there seems to be no globally available priority list. at this moment i could vaccuum the floor, or do the dishes , or go to the gym , or create models, or play video games, or just gchat with friends. is building social bonds better than getting in better shape? are either of those better than a clean home or my own personal enjoyment of playing nba2k? we can probably all agree that chatting with friends and playing video games shouldnt be a top priority, but what about the other items. and none of those are even inherently good things. they arent things like praying or mentoring an at-risk teen or whatever. I'm going to stop this train of thought now, because at this moment , like the book 'the next right thing' i dont think continuing to spew thoughts here is my next 'right' thing.
